  <p><span>Thanks</span> to my brilliant sister I became a Doctor Who fan during one long, glorious, binge-watching week in 2009.  I watched four seasons of "New Who" that week and fell in love with The Doctor.  Fast forward to 2011, and a slightly creepy meet-up, and I met my partner in crime Jess.  She told me all about this fantastical nirvana called Gallifrey One  where Doctor Who fans celebrated nothing but their fandom for a whole weekend in Los Angeles.  Jess already had her ticket and a hotel reservation and I was sold!  A weekend of nothing but Who - what a wonderful concept.
<p><span>And</span> it was truly wonderful.  From the bus ride to the Marriott to the epicly weird roommates to the awesome cosplay.  Gallifrey One had it all.  From small beginnings, Gally has grown to the largest fan-run Doctor Who convention in the US.  By focusing not just on the headliners but also on the producers, designers, sound engineers, writers, and always the fans this convention made itself unique in a world of cookie-cutter cons.  And surrounding interviews with the show makers, they provided an array of fan run panels with far ranging topics covering practically every aspect of fandom.</p> 
<p><span>In</span> 2012, everything kicked off with a jam packed live episode of my favorite (only) podcast: Radio Free Skaro. A lovely mix of stars and behind the scenes masters to start us off and it was non-stop from that point on!  I went to dozens of panels, saw countless interviews, drank my weight in alcohol, fangirled all over Radio Free Skaro, and sang some really terrible karaoke.  I started a comic book obsession which lives to this day and made some of the best friends of my life.  I loved it so much I went back, again and again for five straight years!</p>
<p><span>I</span> missed Gally in 2017 and it felt like a piece of me was gone. Those far-flung Facebook friends I only saw once a year and the pure love of a thing somehow became entrenched in my soul and they were lost to me this year.  So naturally, #Gally1 2018* here I come!!  Ticket’s purchased, hotel’s in flux, flight’s up in the air but I’m going back and it’s going to be fantastic.</p>
